model.py:
    we use this file to create delete models or tables in database
settings.py:
    INSTALLED_APPS = [
        'mention app name'   Model.geek
    ]
    to upload image:
        first we need to go in

        settings.py:
        and the  we have to type
            MEDIA_ROOT = os.join.path(BASE_DIR,'media')
                MEDIA_ROOT is for server path to store files in the computer.

            MEDIA_URL = '/media/'
                MEDIA_URL is the reference URL for browser to access the files over Http.
        
model.py:
    to create image type code

 
Python manage.py makemigrations:
    makemigrations basically generates the SQL commands for preinstalled
    apps (which can be viewed in installed apps in settings.py) and your newly
    created appâ€™s model which you add in installed apps


Python manage.py migrate:
    migrate executes those SQL commands in the database file. 

After above programming we have to go to admin.py

admin.py:
    we have to import model.py
    then we need to map class of model.py  to admin site
    admin.site.register(class name)
